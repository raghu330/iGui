What does this code piece do?
This code converts 6-hourly UM fields file data into grib2 format after
regridding the data to 0.25x0.25 degree spatial resolution by imbibing
analysis fields from the yesterday's 18Z time (based on Dr. SM).

Output:
This script produce output files as multiple 6 hourly forecasts data from
different input files such as pd, pd, pe, etc., So all 6 hourly forecasts data
of different input files will be append to same 6 hourly grib2 outfiles (These
conventions are according to NCUM only!)

Parallel:
As for now, we are using multiprocessing to make parallel run on different files
like pb, pd, pe and its creating child porcess with respect to no of forecast
hours. To make more parallel threads on variable, fcstHours level we may need to
use OpenMPI-Py.

Disclaimers (if any!)
This is just test code as of now and is meant for a specific purpose only!

Standards:
This code conforms to pep8 standards and KISS philosophy.

Code History:
1.  Jul 22nd, 2015: First version by MNRS
2.  Jul 24th, 2015: Grib section editor - version-0.1,
                  : Automation of filenames started
                  : Extraction of required variables
                  : Interpolation scheme to 0.25 degree (MNRS & DJ)
3.  Sep 11th, 2015: Recasted for 6-hourly ouputs (MNRS)
4.  Nov 05th, 2015: Changed fname to a string in getVarInOutFilesDetails() (MNRS)
5.  Nov 07th, 2015: Added to iGui project on github from fcm project (MNRS & AAT)
6.  Nov 09th, 2015: parallelization!!! (AAT)
7.  Nov 10th, 2015: Spawned multiple versions for input (AAT & MNRS)
8.  Nov 12th, 2015: Appending same 6 hourly forecast data of different input
                    files into same 6 hourly grib2 files. (AAT)
9.  Nov 16th, 2015: Added new module/functionality "cubeAverager" to account
                    for two kinds of fields: accumulated or instantaneous (AAT)
10. Dec 02nd, 2015: Added module to create analysis fields from crtAnal.py (MNRS)
                    Corrected for typos (MNRS)
11. Dec 07th, 2015: Freshly added functions/facilities to create analysis fields 
                    by using short forecast files by chossing either instantaneous
                    and average/sum by using past 6 hour's short forecast (AAT)                     
                    Version - 5.0. Ready for alpha release v1.0a (AAT)
12. Dec 11th, 2015: Global MP.LOCK added to avoid communication errors in overwriting
                    /appending grib2 files. (AAT)
                    Few unused modules removed & code cleaning (MNRS): List=netCDF4, types
